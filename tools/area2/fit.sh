# Snapshots rtl/ platform/ target/ projects/ of this worktree into s_<tag>/ (so later edits cannot reach a run in
# progress), adds the build's value macros + seed + extras, and compiles s_<tag>/projects (symlink: projects_a2_<tag>).
# The macros are the ones the RTL still reads with a value (the RSP's lanes, the CPU's caches), at the values the RTL
# defaults to, so the bitstream is the one projects/mirlo.qsf alone builds. The
# features that were once macros of their own are always in now.
# With "map": quartus_map only. WAIT=1: the compile in the foreground, with its exit status (else it runs in the background). DROP="RSP_LANES" leaves that macro out; EXTRA_MACROS="A=1 B=2" adds MIRLO_A=1 ....
