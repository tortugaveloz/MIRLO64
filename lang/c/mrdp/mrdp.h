/* MRDP -- Mirlo's N64-style rasterizer: bit-exact reference model.
 *
 * This file is the contract. The RTL (rtl/mrdp/) must produce the same
 * memory writes, word for word, for the same command stream; the host
 * simulator runs the real game through it.
 *
 * Commands are 64-bit (two 32-bit words, high word first) with the N64 RDP's
 * opcodes in bits [61:56] and, where a field exists on the N64, the N64's bit
 * position. Addresses are SoC byte addresses (SDRAM is 0x40000000..).
 *
 * Fixed-point formats
 *   YH, YM, YL        s11.2   quarter scanlines
 *   XH, XM, XL        s15.16  x of an edge at an integer scanline: XH and XM
 *                              at floor(YH/4), XL at floor(YM/4)
 *   DxHDy, DxMDy,     s15.16  per scanline
 *   DxLDy
 *   shade R,G,B,A     s15.16  0..255 in the integer part; value at
 *                              (x = XH, y = floor(YH/4)); DaDx per pixel,
 *                              DaDe per scanline along the H edge
 *   S, T              s15.16  texel units; with perspective, S = s * W
 *   W                 s15.16  > 0 (1/w, scaled per triangle: only S/W and
 *                              T/W matter)
 *   Z                 s16.15  depth16 = clamp(Z >> 15, 0, 0xFFFF); larger is
 *                              farther. Z compare passes if depth16 < buffer
 *                              (opaque / xlu / inter) or <= buffer (decal: the
 *                              geom core pulls decals toward the camera)
 *   scissor, rect     u10.2
 *   texrect S,T       s10.5, DsDx/DtDy s5.10
 *
 * Sampling: one sample per pixel, at the pixel centre (x + 0.5, y + 0.5).
 * A pixel is drawn if its centre is in [x_left, x_right) of the scanline and
 * the centre row is in [YH, YL). No coverage / anti-aliasing.
