# MIRLO 64: the video output

`rtl/soc/n64_video.sv` reads the frame buffer the game's VI registers name and sends the Pocket what the N64's VI
sends a television. This page is the frame, its timing, and how each picture is placed in it. The VI's registers and
interrupt are in [mips.md](mips.md), the filters in [rdp.md](rdp.md) (The scan-out), the registers the runtime writes in
[control.md](control.md) (`VIDEO_FRAMEBUFFER`).

## The frame

The Pocket is sent the VI's fields: 640 x 240, progressive, or, for a 640 x 480 interlaced picture, its two fields woven
into a 640 x 480 progressive frame (below). The scaler modes of `pkg/pocket/Cores/tortuga.Mirlo64/video.json` are
640 x 240 (0) and 640 x 480 (1), both shown 4:3. A line is the VI's own, 640 pixels wide. The pixel clock, `clk_vid`, is
25 MHz (the system clock divided by 2.5): a 640 x 240 frame's pixel is two of its clocks, the second skipped (the video
interface's `video_skip`), so the figures below are 12.5 MHz clocks; a woven frame's pixel is one.

| TV system | Clocks a line | Lines a field | A field | Rate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NTSC (and MPAL) | 790 (nine lines in vblank: 788) | 264 | 1,042,710 system clocks | 59.940 Hz |
| PAL | 800 (fifty lines in vblank: 792) | 313 | 1,250,000 system clocks | 50.000 Hz |
| NTSC, woven | 790 of 25 MHz (eighteen: 788) | 528 | 1,042,710 system clocks | 59.940 Hz |
| PAL, woven | 800 of 25 MHz (a hundred: 792) | 626 | 1,250,000 system clocks | 50.000 Hz |

The field's length is the N64's for each system, so the VI's line counter and its interrupt keep the console's timing (a
woven frame's lines are half as long: the VI counts every other one). The picture is 240 lines (woven: 480) in both; a PAL
field has more lines of blanking, not a taller picture.

The timing never stalls: the frame's words go from the SDRAM to the pads through a FIFO of 16,384 words, and a word
that is not there in time shows black. The frame buffer's address is taken at the frame boundary, the first line of
vblank, so a new one never tears the frame being sent.

## The TV system

Until the game programs the VI, the system is the one of the ROM's region: the runtime writes it to bit 18 of
`VIDEO_FRAMEBUFFER.WIDTH`. From then on it is what the game's `VI_V_SYNC` says: 525 lines (a value of 512 to 575) is
NTSC, 625 lines (576 to 703) is PAL, and any other value changes nothing. The system is taken at the frame boundary and
the timing changes where that field ends, so no field is cut short. Bit 19 of the same register reads the system in
use.

## The picture

The picture is the VI's, by the game's own registers:

| VI register | What the scan-out does with it |
|---|---|
| `VI_ORIGIN` | The frame buffer's address |
| `VI_WIDTH` | The pitch: the pixels from one row of the buffer to the next |
| `VI_H_START` | The picture's window in the line: its first clock and its width, counted from the VI's first visible clock (108; 128 for PAL) |
| `VI_V_START` | Its window in the field: its first line and its lines, counted from the VI's first visible half-line (37; 95 for PAL) |
| `VI_X_SCALE` | The step through a row, in 1/1024 of a pixel for each clock of the window: clock `i` shows the pixel `(i * X_SCALE) >> 10` |
| `VI_Y_SCALE` | The step through the rows for each line of the window: line `j` shows the row `(j * Y_SCALE) >> 10` |

Outside the window the frame is black. The pixel and the row are the nearest ones, not interpolated; the VI's filters
(anti-alias, divot, dither filter, gamma) work on the frame buffer's own pixels before the scale, as the VI's do. So
one path shows every size: a 320-wide buffer with a scale of 0.5 (each pixel two clocks), a wider one with its own
scale, and a 640-wide one with a scale of 1.

Three cases are not the plain rule:

- **A picture 512 pixels wide or more** is shown with the VI's filters off.
- **A serrated picture** is sent woven, 480 lines a frame (below).
- **A window taller than the field** from its first line (some PAL modes stretch a 240-row buffer over more lines than
  the frame has) is fitted to what is left of the field, not cut: it has fewer lines and a proportionally larger step
  through the rows, so its first and last lines show the same rows as the VI's (`lang/n64rt/n64rt_vifit.h`).

The runtime works the window, the scales and the words to read for a row out of the VI's registers
(`lang/n64rt/n64rt_io.c`, `vi_width_gamma`) and writes them to `VIDEO_FRAMEBUFFER`.

`VI_H_START` 0 (libultra's `osViBlack`) shows black. A frame buffer so close to the end of the RDRAM that the picture
would run past it shows black too.

## Interlaced pictures

A serrated picture (`VI_STATUS`' SERRATE with a hi-res `VI_WIDTH`: 640 x 480 as two fields of 240 lines) is sent woven:
each field the VI shows, the scan-out sends the whole 640 x 480 picture the two fields make, as a progressive frame of 480
lines, in the scaler mode 1. On a television the two fields make that picture; the Pocket shows it as the frame it is.

- **The lines** are the two fields' in turn, from the lower of the two fields' origins (`rcp_vi`'s base: libultra's
  first field's; the second field's origin is one 640-pixel row on): `VI_WIDTH` 640 with `VI_Y_SCALE` from 1.5 to 2.0, or
  1280 with 1.0 (a pitch of two rows). The frame's line 2 *j* + *p* is the field *p*'s line *j* as the VI shows it: the
  row `VI_Y_SCALE`'s step reaches at the field's line *j*, one row on for the second field -- with 2.0, the picture's rows
  in order. The window is the field's, twice its lines; the crop setting too. A serrated picture of another kind (a
  240-row buffer, another pitch) is not a pair of fields and is sent as any picture is.
- **The field** is still the VI's: `VI_CURRENT`'s bit 0 alternates every field while SERRATE is set, and the game's
  handler writes each field's origin as on the console; the frame is sent every field, so a picture that changes from one
  field to the next shows each change.
- **Why not 480i:** the Pocket does take interlaced fields (the frame features of its video interface), but writes each
  field over the picture it is showing: its output -- 60.00 Hz on the Dock and on its own screen -- overtakes the 59.94 Hz
  fields every 16.7 s, and for about 0.75 s a change of picture shows torn there. A progressive frame it keeps whole until
  it is shown (it repeats one instead), and the woven frame is the picture the fields make.
- **A change** between a progressive picture and a woven one changes the frame's timing where the field ends, and costs
  one black frame: the first frame of the new kind is not the one the frame before announced.

The bandwidth is a hi-res picture's twice: 153,600 words a frame, 14.7 % of the SDRAM's cycles.

## The core's settings

"Crop Vertical" (none, 8 or 12 lines) blanks that many lines at the top and at the bottom of the picture, and "Crop
Right" (none or 1 column) its last column, a column being a pixel of a 320-wide picture. They are relative to the
picture's window; the frame and its timing do not change.

## Tests

`sim/vi_filter/regress.sh` builds the scan-out alone against a model of it (`tb_vi.cpp`) and checks the pads pixel for
pixel: the filters, pitches and scales other than 320, windows, the crop settings, serrated pictures (the woven frame's
rows and timing, the slot words), PAL and a change of TV system between fields. `sim/vi_filter/vifit_test.c` checks the
fitted window's arithmetic. `lang/n64rt/test/il_test.c` is a game that drives a serrated picture as libultra does: on the
SoC in `sim/mips_soc` (`VGA=1 VGAT=1`: each frame off the pads, and the slot each line's end says) or on a Pocket, where `ROWCODE` puts each
row's number in it as a bar code to read off a capture, and `FLASH` turns between two pictures, for catching a tear.
