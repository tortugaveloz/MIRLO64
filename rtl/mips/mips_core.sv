// Mirlo-N64's CPU: a MIPS that executes an N64 ROM's code as it is.
//
// The reference is sim/n64/cpu.c; sim/mips checks this against it
// instruction by instruction while both run a ROM.
//
//  - The VR4300's instructions with 32-bit addresses: MIPS II, the TLB,
//    ERET, ldc1/sdc1 of the FPU's register pairs, and its 64-bit integers
//    by levels, what a level leaves out being a Reserved Instruction for
//    the runtime to do on the registers it finds:
//      W64      registers of 64 bits; ld, sd, lwu, dmfc0/dmtc0; the branches
//               on all 64 bits. An and / or / xor / nor / slt or a trap
//               whose operand is not a 32-bit value is left out (D finds it).
//      W64_ALU  a unit at M: dadd(i)(u), dsub(u), and those and / or / xor /
//               nor / slt
//      W64_SH   (in the unit) the d-shifts, a byte or a bit a cycle
//      W64_MD   (with the unit) dmult(u): four products of the operands'
//               halves on the DSP block the 32-bit multiply has, summed a
//               word a time (8 cycles in the background, as the VR4300's);
//               HI and LO of 64 bits
//      W64_DIV  (with W64_MD) ddiv(u), a bit a cycle on a divider twice as
//               wide: left out (a Reserved Instruction), the runtime divides
//    Without W64_DIV, a ddiv of two words and a ddivu of two unsigned words
//    are done on the 32-bit divider; another is a Reserved Instruction.
//    Never in the core: ldl, ldr, sdl, sdr, lld, scd, a trap on a 64-bit
//    operand. COP0 register 7 (MCTL)
//    reads the levels in its bits 31 (ALU), 30 (SH), 29 (MD), 28 (DIV), 0 on
//    a core before them. Without W64_MD HI and LO
//    are 32 bits and the runtime keeps a 64-bit product or quotient itself:
//    it sets COP0 register 7's bit 0, and mfhi / mflo / mthi / mtlo are
//    Reserved Instructions until the next multiply or divide clears it.
//    Without W64 every 64-bit instruction is one and registers are 32 bits.
//  - The 64 bits are beside the pipeline, not in it. A register's upper half
//    is kept as its difference from the lower half's sign (hx = upper ^
//    {32{lower[31]}}): zero for a 32-bit value. E computes 32 bits, as ever.
//    What makes or needs a 64-bit value runs at M in the unit, a "late"
//    result like a load's. An hx is read from the register file only -- an
//    instruction waits in D while one of its registers is still on its way
//    from the unit or a 64-bit load -- so nothing of it is forwarded.
//  - The TLB, three ways. TLB_EN: the VR4300's 32 entries (tlbwi, tlbwr,
//    tlbp, tlbr; searched one a cycle, see below). Neither: none -- a mapped
//    access is the runtime's to do (with N64WIN it arrives as an address
//    error). TLB_RAM: translation tables of the runtime's making, in block
//    RAM -- one for data and one for fetches (an instruction and what it
//    reaches may share an index: with one table neither could stay), each of
//    512 entries, one for a 4 KiB page by its number's low 9 bits
//    (va[20:12]): {valid, dirty, global, ASID, va[31:21], the physical page
//    pa[28:12]}. A mapped access or fetch reads its page's entry: one that is
//    valid, of this page and this ASID (EntryHi's, unless global) translates
//    it; anything else is the TLB's exception (TLBL or TLBS: code 2 or 3; a
//    store to an entry that is not dirty: Mod, code 1) with BadVAddr the
//    address and EntryHi its page pair, as the VR4300 leaves them, for the
//    runtime to fill the entry from what the game has mapped -- a page of
//    any size, 4 KiB of it at a time -- and return to the instruction.
//    With MON a fault that goes to the monitor level leaves BadVAddr and
//    EntryHi as the game has them (a page the game's wired entry maps misses
//    the tables where the VR4300's TLB never would: an exception handler
//    that runs from a mapped page must not have a miss on its first fetch
//    replace the BadVAddr it is about to read): the address is COP0 register 22's,
//    which only reads, and the monitor level writes BadVAddr by mtc0 for the
//    exception it delivers to the game. An
//    entry is written through COP0 register 23: a write stores the entry of
//    EntryHi's page (the pair's page by the value's bit 4) and ASID:
//      bits 28-12 pa[28:12]    bit 4 va[12]    bit 3 the table (1: fetches)
//      bit 5 cacheable (a fetch from the page may use the I-cache: FPG)
//      bit 2 global    bit 1 dirty (a store is allowed)    bit 0 valid
//    and it reads 0x5442_0000, with bit 3 set when the last TLB exception
//    was a fetch's (its entry is the fetch table's) and bit 0 set on a core
//    with MON: 0 on a CPU without the tables. The VR4300's own TLB
//    instructions do nothing there -- but with MON, while the game runs
//    (MCTL.GAME), tlbwi, tlbwr, tlbr and tlbp are a Reserved Instruction for
//    the monitor level, which keeps the 32 entries itself and does them as
//    the VR4300 would (Index's P bit, which only the monitor level can write
//    by mtc0, for a tlbp that finds none). The monitor level also writes, by
//    mtc0 and while ERL is set, Cause's BD and ExcCode and Context's BadVPN2:
//    a page no entry of the game's maps is a TLB exception of the game's, which
//    the monitor delivers (the CPU's own EPC / Cause / vector work, done by
//    software: lang/n64rt/n64rt_os.c, tlb_deliver). With N64WIN code fetched
//    from a mapped page is the game's, as KSEG0's. A fetch from a mapped page runs through the I-cache when its
//    fetch-table entry has the cacheable bit and FPG gave the CPU its page registers (see "The page registers"
//    above F): two registers keep the last two such pages, so the table is read (four cycles) only when a fetch
//    changes to a third page; any write to COP0 23 empties them.
//  - Five stages: F (I-cache), D (decode, registers, branches -- a delay slot
//    costs nothing), E (ALU), M (D-cache, the slow path, COP0/COP1,
//    exceptions), W (write-back). Forwarding into E from M and W; a branch
//    in D waits for a result still in E, a load's for one cycle.
//  - Caches: 16 KiB I, 8 KiB D, direct mapped, 32-byte lines, physically
//    tagged; KSEG0 RDRAM only. The D-cache writes through an 8-entry write
//    buffer: memory is always current for the engines that read it (the RSP
//    firmware, RDP, the audio core). A read goes out only with the buffer
//    empty. ld, sd, ldc1 and sdc1 to cached memory are two words in two
//    cycles, through the cache and the write buffer as any other. Uncached,
//    device and TLB-mapped accesses (but a fetch from a cacheable mapped page,
//    FPG) take the slow path (one single-word access; two for a 64-bit one).
//  - Memory is word-native (sim/n64/n64.h): big-endian byte k of a word is
//    lane 3 - k (BIG; little-endian: lane k).
//  - COP1 instructions run at M in fpu_n64 (single precision, doubles
//    through float); the operations it does not implement are Reserved
//    Instructions.
//  - FAST: the same five stages with their longest paths cut, for a clock
//    half as fast again as the rest of the SoC's.
//      F  the I-cache's word goes into D before its tag is compared: one of
//         another line is dropped there a cycle later (d_fmiss), the line is
//         read and the fetch made again.
//      D  a branch is not decided there. The fetch follows a guess -- a
//         jump's target, a backward branch taken, a forward one not, a
//         register jump not -- and the branch is decided at E on forwarded
//         operands, as any other instruction's (it no longer waits in D for
//         them). A wrong guess is put right in the cycle after (rd_res,
//         rd_fix): what was fetched behind the delay slot is dropped, two
//         cycles lost; a likely branch not taken drops its delay slot there.
//      M  a load takes the D-cache's word before its tag is compared: one of
//         another line is not written back, the line is read and the
//         instruction run again from its fetch (rp_pend), which costs
//         nothing more -- the line takes longer to come than the instruction
//         to return. A load in a delay slot cannot be fetched again without
//         its branch: it waits a cycle for its tag instead (m_w1).
//    Nothing the caches' tags say reaches the pipeline's advance.

// d_imiss then fetches the instruction again: from a register that holds the page, the line is read in (FS_REFILL,
// d_fpfn is where from); from none, the table is walked (FS_WALK, FS_XLAT) -- the entry loads a register
// (pg_ld) and F goes back to FS_RUN -- or, for a page that is not cacheable, fetched uncached as ever (FS_SLOW).
// A write to COP0 23 (any table entry) empties the registers; an ASID that is not the entry's is no hit.

// mapped at a virtual address whose bits [IW+1:12] differ from the physical ones (the VR4300's cache has this
// with its two colour bits too); a hit-type cache op on the I-cache then drops the line under every colour (ic_alias).
