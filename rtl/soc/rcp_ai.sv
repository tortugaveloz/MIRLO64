// The N64's AI (Audio Interface) in hardware (MIRLO_AI; docs/mips.md "The AI in hardware"): the registers, the two-buffer
// queue, the DMA reader and the resampler to the Pocket's 48 kHz FIFO.
//
// AI, 0x0450_0000 (the game's lw / sw reach it as a device access, as the MI's and the VI's: mips_core's AIW, mirlo_mips.sv's
// decode; the registers repeat through the 1 MiB):
//   00 DRAM_ADDR  write: the buffer's address (8-byte aligned; the RDRAM's 8 MiB)
//   04 LEN        write: the length in bytes (a multiple of 8; 0 is ignored): the DMA starts with it when the AI is idle,
//                 else it is queued as the second buffer (a third is dropped, as the real one's). Read: the bytes left
//                 of the buffer being played
//   08 CONTROL    bit 0 DMA enable (clear: the reader stops where it is)
//   0C STATUS     read {full [31], busy [30], 0, DMA on [25], 1 [24], 1 [20], full [0]}: full = a second buffer is queued,
//                 busy = a buffer is being played (the console's: the bits 24 and 20 read 1 there). Any write
//                 clears the AI interrupt (MI_INTR's AI bit: `clr`)
//   10 DACRATE    write [13:0]: the DAC's clock divisor: the sample rate is 48,681,812 / (DACRATE + 1). The runtime is woken
//                 (`chg`) to compute the resampler's step from it and write it (`step_we`)
//   14 BITRATE    write: ignored
// A read of any register but STATUS is AI_LEN, as the console's (the others are write-only there).
//
// What it plays is what the runtime's software AI did (n64rt_rsp.c ai_service / fetch_frame), step for step, so that the
// output is the same sample stream: the Pocket's FIFO is kept at its target (256 words, 5.3 ms: the reader leads the heard
// audio by that, and so do AI_LEN and the interrupts; 512 words, 10.7 ms, before 2026-10-09) by time, not by reading ahead -- an output sample is made whenever the FIFO is below it. A sample is made from the frame pair (previous, next)
// of the game's 16-bit stereo frames (L high, R low) by a phase accumulator, linearly:
//     out = prev + ((next - prev) * (phase >> 1) >> 15)        phase: Q16 frames, += step per output sample
// where step = rate * 65536 / 48000 (the runtime's). The reader fetches a frame, a word at a time, from the RDRAM in the SDRAM,
// as the PI's engine does (a master of the Pocket bridge's port, `req` held until `ack`). When the AI has nothing to play
// (no buffer, or the DMA disabled) it writes silence to hold the FIFO's lead, for an eighth of a second (6000 words),
// then nothing until the next buffer (and the FIFO is first primed with silence up to the target, as the software did).
// The AI interrupt (`irq`, a pulse) is the console's: it rises when a buffer is started on an
// idle AI (the LEN write) and when the buffer read to its end is replaced by the one queued; when the queue empties there is
// none. (Before 2026-10-09 it rose at the end of every buffer, the last included, and not at a start: a driver that queues
// its next buffer from the interrupt, as Nintendo's HVQM2 timekeeper does, got a silent gap after each buffer.) The
// buffers are the console's fillcount: a buffer is current from its LEN write to the fetch of its last word.
