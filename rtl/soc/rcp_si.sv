// The N64's SI (Serial Interface) and its PIF RAM in hardware (MIRLO_SI; docs/mips.md "The SI in hardware"): the registers, the
// 64-byte DMA to and from the RDRAM, the PIF RAM itself, and the handshake with the runtime that plays the PIF's command
// interpreter (the joybus: controllers, paks, EEPROM stay software).
//
// SI, 0x0480_0000 (the game's lw / sw reach it as a device access, as the MI's: mips_core's SIW, mirlo_mips.sv's decode; the
// registers repeat every 0x20 bytes):
//   00 DRAM_ADDR       write: the RDRAM address (8-byte aligned, 24 bits; ignored while a DMA is under way); read it back. The DMA
//                      counts it up as it goes: after a DMA it reads 64 bytes on
//   04 PIF_ADDR_RD64B  write: starts the DMA PIF RAM -> RDRAM, 64 bytes (the written address is ignored: one PIF RAM)
//   10 PIF_ADDR_WR64B  write: starts the DMA RDRAM -> PIF RAM, 64 bytes
//   18 STATUS          read {irq [12], 0, error [3], 0, IO busy [1], DMA busy [0]}; any write clears the interrupt (and the error)
// A start while a DMA is under way is ignored and sets the error bit (the console's DMA error).
//
// PIF RAM, 0x1FC0_07C0 .. 0x1FC0_07FF (KSEG0 or KSEG1): 16 words, the CPU's lw / sw (mips_core's SIW window: no address error),
// a block RAM, one word a read (c_q the cycle after the address). The CPU stalls (c_busy) while the DMA owns the RAM. Byte 63 (the
// low byte of word 15) is the PIF's status byte: a write leaves it 0, as the software PIF did ("taken": a game that looks
// finds nothing pending); the run flag that was in it (bit 0) is what the PIF acts on:
//   `joy`  a block with the run flag has been written (by the DMA or by the CPU): the block holds joybus commands. Once set, it
//          stays: the PIF repeats the commands at every read of the block (libultra writes the request once and then only
//          reads, a frame after the other -- the replies it finds are of that read).
//   IO busy (STATUS bit 1) is the PIF working: the runtime is told (`ev`, a pulse: MONITOR.PEND's bit 4) and clears it when it
//          has written the replies into the PIF RAM (`done_we`, MONITOR.SIDONE). It is set at the end of a WR64B that carried
//          the run flag, and by an RD64B when `joy` is set and the PIF is not busy already (the commands run again before the
//          block is read: that read is deferred -- DMA busy, nothing moved -- until the PIF is done, as the console's SI waits
//          for the PIF; one that finds the PIF busy waits for that run, and the first read after the run a WR64B made does not
//          run them again: its replies are there). A start of either DMA waits for the PIF to be done.
//   `pif_n` the console's time: SIDONE's write carries how long the console's PIF takes over those commands (RCP cycles, the
//          runtime's estimate from what answered), counted down from then; an RD64B moves nothing until it is out (DMA busy,
//          as the console's read is held while the PIF talks to the joybus: ~0.6 ms for one controller read, ~1.55 ms for four), so
//          a game's thread that polls the controllers in a loop leaves the others the time it would on the console. The run
//          a WR64B made is counted from there, which is the console's time for libultra's write-then-read. A WR64B moves its
//          16 words WR_WAIT cycles after the start, the console's 4,065 to the interrupt less the move's own.
// The SI interrupt (`irq`, a pulse: MI_INTR's SI bit; the flag in STATUS bit 12) rises at the end of each DMA.
//
// The DMA is a master of the Pocket bridge's port (mirlo_mips.sv), a word at a time, ~20 cycles each: `req` is held until `ack`
// (a read: the word is `rdata` in the cycle of the ack, and goes into the PIF RAM in it; a write: `wdata` is the PIF RAM's word,
// held while the request is up).
